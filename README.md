# yokai-senjafuda

This [digital exhibition](https://social-sin.github.io/yokai-senjafuda/) focuses on tiny slips of paper—senjafuda 千社札—that depict Japanese ghosts and monsters—yōkai 妖怪. Both senjafuda and yōkai have their roots in Japanese popular culture in the early modern period (17th-19th centuries), and both continue to cast a spell on viewers today.

This site was made using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/).

The site uses items from the University of Oregon's [Yōkai Senjafuda](https://glam.uoregon.edu/yokaisenjafuda/page/welcome) digital exhibit, which is worth a visit!

Metadata is drawn from the following Google Sheet:

- [Yōkai Senjafuda Digital Collection Metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WnKHxT1zVdn8n8u5q_-DRSlZzKr0WHpVrApCwEvsnAE/edit?usp=sharing)


Objects are collected in this zip file: 

- [Yōkai Senjafuda Digital Collection Media Files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10aXCFdBjULqRhjHh_GpFsEpsEpxogvmB/view?usp=sharing) (Includes image files, pdfs, and mp3s)

# collectionbuilder-gh
A project to generate a free and simple digital collection site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

Gather your digital objects together and create your metadata using the [CollectionBuilder-GH Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/edit?usp=sharing). 
Then click the green "use this template" button above to create your repository, add your metadata and configure the repository to fit your collection and settings.

See [Getting Started Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information. 

View the [demo site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/).

**Note:** 
Since `collectionbuilder-gh` uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images. GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB.

## Demo CollectionBuilder with our Workshop Tutorial

If you'd like to demo CollectionBuilder, we've made [a step-through tutorial](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/workshop/gh/) using the following spreadsheet and zipped directory. (The tutorial uses items from our [Psychiana Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/psychiana/), which is worth a visit!)

Metadata is drawn from the following Google Sheet: 

- [Psychiana Digital Collection Metadata](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x48Te3duPAxh53foEihQVKTfCKUjaCCbH7TrMMd_yU4)

Objects are collected in this zip file: 

- [Psychiana Digital Collection Media Files](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/collectionbuilder/demo-objects.zip) (Includes image files, pdfs, and mp3s)

These files are stored in this [CollectionBuilder-gh Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dTO8-3lusaKBdYyauyg_ziVqwLA4Fons?usp=sharing), along with some other metadata sheets and zipped object directories that can be used for other workshops and demonstrations.

## More on CollectionBuilder

`collectionbuilder-gh` is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.
It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

`collectionbuilder-gh` aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the example, with the potential to scaffold learning of a multitude of transferable digital and data skills.
A project in "minimal computing", it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.

Learn about:

- Git and GitHub basics
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), plaintext writing and content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JS literacy
- commandline literacy
- GitHub collaboration and project management
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) basics
- working in the Open, open source and open data
- digital libraries concepts such as "collections as data", minimal computing, data-driven design

> We prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV spreadsheets over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).
## Features

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for GitHub Pages 
- Layout using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- Mapping using [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
- Tables using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
- Galleries using [lightGallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/)
- Simple [lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) search 
- Rich markup using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
